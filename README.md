## Research Question <a name="research-question"></a> <br/> 
##### Date: 02 February 2020 <br>

### Juxtaposing California's Cap and Trade with Climate Policy of Phase-Out to derive an ideal policy for Mitigation and Reduction of green house gases. <br>

##### Topic: Visualizing the Juxtaposition of  California’s Cap and Trade and Climate Policy of Phase-Out

##### Question: In order to find out if the Phase-Out Policy would be an ideal solution to substantially reduce the Green House Emissions instead of Carbon Cap and Trade

##### Significance: In order to understand the loopholes in the current policy that creates market opportunities instead of mitigation. 

### <u> Areas of Interests </u>

<b> Understanding Policy with reference to following aspects </b>

- Deciding the Scope

	- Inclusion of Green House Gases
	- Inclusion of different sectors

- Setting the Cap

	- Targeting to reducing greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions by __% below 1990 levels (pre-industrial) by ____ (year).

- Offset Sources

	- Forests

- Distribution of allowances

	- Free Allocations
	- State-administered auctions
	- Private Markets

- Temporary Flexibility

	- "Banking” of allowances for use
at a later time
	- Holding limits

- Compliance and oversight

	- Verify Emissions 

- Revenue Transfers

	- Mitigation

		- Clean Energy
		- Paying Back Ecological Debt

<b> California Cap and Trade </b>

- Understanding basics of California's Cap and Trade Program. 

	- California Code of Regulations : California Cap on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Market-Based Compliance Mechanisms

		- Performance for  2012 to 2020

			- The California Legislature in 2006 set the first climate target of 1990 emissions levels by 2020 based on international recommendations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 

				- In 2016, California
passed legislation setting a new target of reducing greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.

	- Criticism of California Cap on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Market-Based Compliance Mechanisms

		- Free Allocation of Allowances

			- Offset Allocations and Transfers

		-  The  loose definition of forests used by the UN, FAO and other multilateral agencies promotes the expansion of industrial monoculture tree plantations and aims to trade the carbon “stored” in trees.

			- Destruction of healthy eco systems and forests
			- Landgrabs
			- Human Rights Violations
			- Cultural Destruction of Indigenous Rights

		- It  provides not only additional finance for polluting industries but also creates a new discourse that allows them to brand their pollution as “green”, “carbon neutral” or “sustainable”.
		- Unclear Offset Locations
		- Unclear Offset Trasfers
		- Creation of Economic opportunities instead of mitigation opportunities 
		- Distraction from Real Solutions

<b> Climate Policy of Phase-Out </b>
- Understanding Basics of Phase Out Policy

	- Targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions

		- Provision of Cap and Trade with Phase Out
		- Economic Opportunity with Mitigation Opportunity
		- Accelerated Transitions

	- Advantages of Climate Policy of Phase Out

		- Monetary Allocation of Allowances
		- No offsets offered
		- Mitigation at Source

	- Factors that requires strict surveillance

		- Offset Location

			- Definition of Forests for Offsets 

		- Transferred production to developing or third world countries. 
		- Offset Transfers
		- Reduction in absolute emissions and not net emissions
	

### <u> Anticipated Learnings </u>

- An ideal policy for Mitigation

- Acknowledgement of loopholes in current policy

- Redefining the definition of Forests

### <u> Target Audience </u>

- General Population
